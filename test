The configuration snippet you provided appears to be part of a Helm chart or Kubernetes manifest aimed at simplifying the deployment of penetration testing (pen-test) clusters. Let's break it down:

### Overview

1. **Preset Title and Description**: 
   - The title indicates that this configuration is specifically for a penetration testing setup.
   - The description explains that the configuration aids in deploying pen-test clusters using custom values for security profiles (`seccompProfile` and `appArmorProfile`).

### Global Configuration

- **Global Security Profiles**:
  - **seccompProfile**: This section allows the specification of a Seccomp profile, which is used in Kubernetes to restrict the system calls that a container can make. This is crucial for enhancing security by minimizing the attack surface.
    - **type**: This field specifies the type of Seccomp profile (e.g., `RuntimeDefault`, `Unconfined`, or a custom profile).
    - **localhostProfile**: This field should contain the name of the custom Seccomp profile if the type is set to a custom profile.
    
  - **appArmorProfile**: Similar to `seccompProfile`, this section defines the AppArmor security profile for the containers.
    - **type**: Indicates the type of AppArmor profile (e.g., `RuntimeDefault`, `Unconfined`, or a custom profile).
    - **localhostProfile**: Specifies the name of the custom AppArmor profile if applicable.

### Required Values

- The commented lines (starting with `#`) indicate that certain global values must be set for the configuration to be valid. These are:
  - **seccompProfile.type**: A required field that specifies the type of Seccomp profile.
  - **seccompProfile.localhostProfile**: A required field that specifies the custom Seccomp profile name.
  - **appArmorProfile.type**: A required field for the AppArmor profile type.
  - **appArmorProfile.localhostProfile**: A required field for the AppArmor profile name.

### Services Configuration

- **ecm-services**:
  - **enabled**: This boolean flag indicates whether the ECM (Enterprise Content Management) services are enabled or not.
  - **eric-ecmeoc-notification**: This could be a specific service related to notifications in the ECM environment. It appears that the configuration for this service may include the `seccompProfile`, which suggests that it will inherit or utilize the global `seccompProfile` settings.

### Conclusion

This configuration is essential for setting up a secure environment for penetration testing within a Kubernetes cluster. By specifying Seccomp and AppArmor profiles, it helps ensure that the containers operate within defined security boundaries, mitigating potential vulnerabilities.
