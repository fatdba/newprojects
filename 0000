Let me begin by introducing myself. My name is Prashant Dixit, and I bring over 18 years of experience working extensively across database systems, middleware technologies, and enterprise infrastructure. I currently serve as a Senior Database Engineer at RENAPS, where I’ve been engaged for the past six months. I'm a certified middleware & database expert with a strong focus on performance tuning, optimization, and ensuring system stability. I also hold the title of Oracle ACE, which reflects my ongoing contribution and expertise within the Oracle ecosystem.

Today, I’d like to walk you through the middleware support proposal we’ve prepared for Glencore’s Oracle Fusion Middleware environment, with a particular focus on your Forms and Reports setup.


I have reviewed the file you have shared witrh us last time about currenrt infra. 
Your current setup includes Oracle Fusion Middleware 12c (12.2.1.3.0), which is nearing end-of-support. It's hosted on Oracle Linux 7.9 VMs using a standalone domain architecture—without a load balancer or clustered setup. Each environment (DEV, PROD, DR) has 1 AdminServer and 2 Managed Servers, with monitoring done via Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM).




Scope of Engagement
================================
We’ve outlined two models of engagement to support your middleware environment:

1. On-Demand (Reactive) Support
-------------------------------------------------------
This model is ideal if you prefer support only when an issue arises. Once onboarded, we remain on standby to respond to incidents as requested. Some of the key support scenarios we cover include:

WebLogic server crashes, JVM memory issues, Node Manager failures
Forms/Reports timeout, BI Publisher session hangs
Thread dump analysis, GC log reviews, JDBC leak diagnostics
Certificate expiries, console login failures, deployment errors
Recovery support after failed patches or configuration rollbacks
Each incident is handled with full diagnostics and resolution planning, keeping business continuity in focus.

2. Classic Support & Maintenance (Proactive)
---------------------------------------------------------
This model is more comprehensive and preventive, focusing on daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance tasks that ensure your environment remains stable and optimized. Our proactive support includes:

WebLogic Health Checks: Validating Admin & Managed Server uptime, Node Manager status
Log Analysis: Reviewing server logs to detect early signs of issues
Memory & CPU Management: Monitoring heap usage, garbage collection, thread behavior
Integration Health: Monitoring JDBC pools, JMS queues, web service endpoints
Security Compliance: Validating SSL certificates, keystore settings, audit trails
Reporting: Monthly dashboards showing uptime, incidents, and actionable recommendations

This structured support gives your team the confidence that your middleware stack is always secure, responsive, and aligned with best practices.

Next Steps
Following this discussion, we’d be happy to:
Finalize your preferred support model
Complete the onboarding and access process
Define escalation paths and communication protocols

Also, as part of the attached proposal document, you will find tables summarizing the estimated hours for both support models. They are meant to give you a clearer understanding of the level of effort involved on a monthly basis or ad-hoc basis and help facilitate decision-making around support planning and resource allocation.

We’re committed to delivering dependable and expert-led support for your middleware systems and ensuring smooth operations across your environments.

Thank you, and I now welcome any questions or feedback you may have.
